                    <p class="font-normal text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">Semantic tag elements are only available on HTML5 version.It help us to figure out what exactly we are writing inside the HTML tag.Before Semantic tag arrival we were used to use div tag which normally doesnâ€™t give us enough info about the written contents inside the tag but semantic tags (Footer,Header,Nav and so on....) givs us clear idea about our activity inside that tag element.</p>

                    <p class="font-normal text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">The inline elements and the inline block elements one of the basic important concepts of the web development and sometimes it can be confusing for the developers.So Let's see some difference between this two.
                        Inline elements take only necessary width of the webpage means inline block elements takes the full available width of it.Inline elements don't start new line while inline block elements always starts a new line.Inline elements don't have top or bottom but inline block elements have it.</p>
